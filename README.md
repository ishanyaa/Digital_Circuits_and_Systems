## Overview

This repository contains **Verilog practice questions and implementations** for the course *Digital Circuits and Systems (ECS 326/676)*.

These codes were were **practice exercises for Computer Organization** in previous semester, and they can also serve as **supplementary practice material for this course**.

The repository also includes the **course PPT** for reference: [Digital Circuits and Systems - Verilog PPT](https://github.com/ishanyaa/Digital_Circuits_and_Systems/blob/main/Ishanya_Verilog.pdf)

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ishanyaa/Digital_Circuits_and_Systems.git](https://github.com/ishanyaa/Digital_Circuits_and_Systems.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Digital_Circuits_and_Systems
    ```
3.  **Compile and simulate Verilog files** using Icarus Verilog or any Verilog simulator:
    ```bash
    iverilog -o output_file file.v
    vvp output_file
    ```
    *Note: The `bin/` folder contains Icarus Verilog binaries for convenience. Ensure your system paths are set correctly if using these directly.*

4.  Check out the **PPT** in the repository for guidance and explanations of each topic: [Digital Circuits and Systems - Verilog PPT](https://github.com/ishanyaa/Digital_Circuits_and_Systems/blob/main/Ishanya_Verilog.pdf)
